Existing in the program is a collection of type Ticket. This is useful because it is easy to manipulate. Since the program creates the collection by loading it from file on launch, a new Ticket may be necessary as the program runs (a driver checks in at the kiosk). When using an array, it would not be directly possible to add another Ticket. However, by using an ArrayList, the program can update the collection to include the new Ticket.
